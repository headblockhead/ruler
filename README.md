# Ruler
A circuitboard ruler. This is designed by me, for me, so it has some details you may want to change if you are making your own version - like my public SSH key and name.

Looks best when manufactured with black soldermask and with an ENIG surface finish for gold plated copper pads. (Also important as a *lead* ruler is not the best thing to be handling often and ENIG is RoHS compliant.)
